## Episode 1 - Introduction to NodeJs
### üöÄ Key Takeaways from Node.js Episode 1!
This episode dives deep into the fascinating history of Node.js‚Äîhow it was created and how it revolutionized server-side JavaScript. It‚Äôs incredible to see how it transformed the developer ecosystem!

üåü Highlights of Node.js Evolution:
1Ô∏è‚É£ 2009:
Created by Ryan Dahl, addressing the need for a non-blocking I/O system.
Powered by Google's V8 engine (used in Chrome).
2Ô∏è‚É£ 2010:
Launch of npm (Node Package Manager), simplifying JavaScript package sharing and management.
3Ô∏è‚É£ 2011:
 - Windows support added, expanding accessibility.
 - Collaboration with Joyent and Microsoft for development.
4Ô∏è‚É£ 2012:
 - Isaac Schlueter takes over npm's leadership, fostering its growth.
5Ô∏è‚É£ 2014:
 - io.js, a fork of Node.js, emerges to accelerate innovation.
6Ô∏è‚É£ 2015:
 - Node.js and io.js reunite under the Node.js Foundation, ensuring collaborative progress.
7Ô∏è‚É£ 2019:
 - Transition to the OpenJS Foundation, promoting unity across JavaScript ecosystems.

üí° Why Node.js Is a Game-Changer:
Node.js‚Äôs non-blocking I/O model enables highly efficient, scalable applications‚Äîfrom lightweight APIs to enterprise-level systems. It has redefined what's possible in server-side JavaScript development.

## Episode 2 - JS on Server
### üöÄ Key Takeaways from Node.js Episode 2!
This episode dives deep into the fascinating what is server, what is V8 Engine, how does it works behind the scene.
#### What is server?
 - Server is nothing but a remote computer / cpu.
 - when javascript come on the server, it gives us the opportuinity to develop the full stack application.
 - Node.js is C++ code.
 - Even V8 Engine is written in C++ program.
#### What is V8 engine?
 - V8 is Google's open source high-performance JavaScript and WebAssembly engine, written in C++.
 - V8 can be embedded into any C++ application.
 - The job of V8 engine is to execute the JS code.
<pre>
 Javascript -----> V8 Engine -----> Machine code
                   |  C++ code
                   |
                   Reading JavaScript code
 </pre>
 - Node JS is a C++ application with V8 embedded into it.
 - V8 is a  JS Engine that follows ECMAScript standards.
#### What is ECMAScript?
 - ECMAScript is a standard for scripting langauge like Javascript, JScript, ActionScript etc.
 - ECMAScript is a standards / rules that JS Engine follows.

So, V8 follows the ECMAScript standards and Node.js gives the extra super power.

#### V8 is a C++ code. What does it do & wy it is a C++ code

                      | write

                      &darr;
                  Machine Code
                      | This machine code 
                      | understandable by the computer
                      &darr;
                Computer(Binary Code)

## Episode 3 - Let's write code
### üöÄ Key Takeaways from Node.js Episode 3!
This episode dives deep into the fascinating what is window object, global object in browser and in nodejs. How does it works behind the scene.

 - As in browser, the global object is "window". Same in Node.js the global object is "global".
 - "global" is not the part of the V8  engine and it is one of the Super power of Node.js. Which is given to use by node.js.

### When we console "global" and "window" we get 
 
#### This is in Node js

 ![Global Object in Node.js](./assets/globalobject.jpg)

#### This same will happen incase of browser when we console window on the Browser
 ![Window Object in browser](./assets/window.jpg)

### When we console "this' in Node JS and in Browser
#### In Node js it refers to an empty object
 ![this Object in nodejs](./assets/thisnode.jpg)

#### In Browser "this" refers to the same object, "window" but its not the same case.
 ![this Object in nodejs](./assets/windowthis.jpg)

### In browser if we write "window", "this", "self", "frames" all of these gives the global object.

 ![this Object in nodejs](./assets/all.jpg)

 - Node js started using "global" as global object.
 - Because of this there is lot of confusion and after that "Open JS Foundation" comes up with a standard global object for all the runtime environment and there should be a single way to represnt it.
 - So, finally in 2020 Open JS Foundation comes up with "globalThis" object in ECMSScript2020, and globalThis refers to global object in all javascript runtime.
